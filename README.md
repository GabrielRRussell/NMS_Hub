# NMS_Hub
This website is a simple home page for the Galactic Hub Project, No Man's Sky. The goal of this project is to create a sensible, comfortable website that introduces players to the Hub. Wiki's are unnatractive and hard to crawl through, and Reddit is more of a newspaper format, not an informational format. This website will hopefully alleviate the problem caused by these sources.

I don't plan on this becoming a hub of info, it will just stay a one stop shop for first timers.

This website is being tested on the most recent versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. If you wish for a browser to have added compatibillity, open an issue. Internet Explorer will NOT be supported in any version of this website.
