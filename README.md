# NMS_Hub
A website for the No Man's Sky Galactic Hub. Is it official or not? I don't know. This project will most likely be in and out from time to time. It could go dead at any moment, so don't expect much.

This website is being tested on the most recent versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. If you wish for a browser to have added compatibillity, open an issue. Internet Explorer will NOT be supported in any version of this website.
