/* Developer Note: at this point in time, I realize that rgba is really weird. It stacks, so the <main> tag has a setting of 0,0,0,0.8 which means slightly transparent. Transparency on anything on top of that stacks, it doesn't replace the initial transparency. I got the logo fixed anyways, so that's good, right?*/
