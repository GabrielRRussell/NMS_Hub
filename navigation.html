			<h1 class = "title"> Navigating to the Galactic Hub</h1>
			<p class = "article_text">In <i>No Man's Sky</i>, you may find yourself lost at times. The galactic map is very difficult to navigate, but easy to travel with. There are no checkpoints, or compasses. Instead, you have your location, a path to the center, and maybe a location close by that you marked. Here, we'll show you how to get yourself to the hub, and how to navigate it.</p>
			
			<p class = "article_flair">Finding your Location</p>
			<p class = "article_text">As you may already know, you can build various pieces of technology to help you. Since the galactic map does not give you your location, we have to get it another way. Using a Signal Booster that you craft, you can find your planetary coordinates. Craft a Signal Booster, and place it on the ground. Once you have done that, activate it and read the text. In the bottom left corner of the screen, you will see numbers and letters arranged similar to this pattern: XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX. Read the pattern, and note it down. Head to the Path Finder app, and put in your coordinates in the top left. Click the option, "Update Location". You should see four dots on screen: The center of the universe (1), the pilgrim star (2), the Galactic Hub Capitol (3), and your location (4), all marked for convienience. Check your distance from the capitol by looking at the "To Dest" value. It will tell you how many light years away you are. The app automatically assumes that you are able to travel a minimum of 1600 Light Years per jump, so adjust that if you cannot, or can do more at a time.</p>
			<p class = "article_text">If you feel as though you are too far away from the Galactic Hub, don't fret! Simply click the "Draw B. Hole Ring" option, and a red ring will appear on screen. If you have not encountered a black hole yet, here is how they work. A black hole is a wormhole that spits you out closer to the center of the universe, but can only travel in that direction. It can send you to a random location in the red ring, and is slightly closer. If the Galactic Hub is on the other side of the center or pilgrim star, you should try jumping if it brings you closer. This is referred to as black hole roulette. But wait! What if the Hub is in a different direction, and far away? You will want to work on getting Hyperdrive upgrades for your ship, so you can travel the maximum distance possible per jump. After that, you'll just have to keep jumping for a long while until you reach it. Some people take a month to do it. Others do it in a week. Either way, it's possible with time.</p>
			<p class = "article_text">As explained on the Naming Conventions Reddit thread Format: <span style = "color: grey;">"[HUBn-R-###] SystemName (Tags)". "n" is the number assigned to the region, "R" is the race letter: G for Gek, V for Vykeen, K for Korvax, ### is the solar index value.</span> The solar index value is the last four digits of your coordinates, with left padding zeroes removed. So 4193 would be an SI of 4139, but 0045 would be an SI for 45. 0916 would be 916 in SI form <span style = "color: gray;">Example: [HUB-V-62] Systemname [RaMuVC], a Vykeen system with Radnox, Murrine, and Vortex Cubes with a solar index value of 62.</span></p>
			<p class = "article_text">Just a helpful reminder, these are naming conventions for systems. Coordinates are the same all throughout planets in a single system.</p>
