		<h2 class = "article_flair" id = "RLoc">Resource Locations</h2>
		
		<p class = "article_text">In <i>No Mans Sky</i>, there are plenty of extremely rare resources that most players will encounter only rarely. Some resources are limited to certain star systems or planets, so it can make finding that one material you need frustrating. With the hub, plenty of planets with rare materials have been mapped out, allowing you to locate them easily. You won't stress about finding Riggogen ever again, because someone says you're two branches below a planet with plenty of it! We'll put out some planets that have rare materials below, in the form of community farms.</p>
